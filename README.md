A program in C++ to predict collision of cars and calculate their time of collision.

 This program is coded to work with in 3d space to predict collision of two cars. The x,y,z coordinates are used to detect whether the cars are collided or not by calculating distance between them.
 Also the time of collision is calculated by using relative velocities and relative coordinates.
 The accelerate and brake methods can be used to alter the volocities of the cars.
 The move method can be used to change coordinate using velocities in respective direction.
 
 
 HOW TO USE :
 First create the two cars
